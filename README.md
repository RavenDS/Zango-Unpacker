File format must be **.apk**

How to mod your Zango game:
-
1. Unpack your .apk archive in a folder named after the executable (if executable is "david.exe", create a folder named "david")
2. Move the .apk out of the game directory
3. Apply the wanted modifications and try them in-game
4. If the game doesn't run with an extracted folder, repack the folder to an .apk
